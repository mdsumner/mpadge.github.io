# C++ templates and Rcpp

C++ templates are really useful. Templates allow you to code a function able to
accept arguments of different types that can't necessarily be known until
compile time. There is, however, no such thing as an Rcpp template -- all
inputs and outputs must have defined types. This blog entry is about how to
maximise the usefulness of C++ templates in an Rcpp context.

It's not a difficult process, and as often in programming, it's about finding
the most efficient level of abstraction. Templates are one of the coolest ways
to "abstract" C++ code -- generally meaning abstracting away from specific
variable (class, structure, whatever ...) types to generic templated forms that
accept multiple, or indeed any possible, types. Templates in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rust-lang.org">

</a> just work - types are directly inferred, and any potential conflicts will be
caught at compile time.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rust-lang.org">
    rust
</a> is the gold standard in which template abstraction is as pain-free as
possible. C++ templates are, in contrast, somewhat more painful, as a minimal
generic template must be explicitly specified. This is often as simple as replacing some function definition, say:
``` C++
int my_function (int my_integer_input)
{
    int result = my_integer_input;
    // do something with `result`
    return result;
}
```
with a templated version:
``` C++
template <class T>
T my_function_t (T my_generic_input)
{
    T result = my_generic_input;
    // do something with `result`
    return result;
}
```
As it stands, `my_function_t` will accept inputs of any arbitrary kinds. (There
are also ways to permit templated code to only accept objects of some
pre-defined classes.) An Rcpp version of the first function might look like
this:
``` C++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int my_rcpp_function (int my_integer_input)
{
    int result = my_integer_input;
    // do something with `result`
    return result;
}
```
The problem arises when you try to do something like this:
``` C++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
template <class T>
int rcpp_template (T input)
{
    int result = Rcpp::as <int> (input);
    // do something with `result`
    return result;
}
```
and that takes you here:
``` C++
RcppExports.cpp:46:36: error: use of undeclared identifier 'T'
    Rcpp::traits::input_parameter< T >::type input(inputSEXP);
                                                              ^
RcppExports.cpp:46:41: error: no type named 'type' in the global namespace
    Rcpp::traits::input_parameter< T >::type input(inputSEXP);
                                                                    ~~^
2 errors generated.
```
This provides highly informative error messages that clearly indicate that the
cause is the ability to infer appropriate `inputSEXP` types (itself a necessity
of **R** being written in C, not C++, and so knowing nothing about inferred
types or templates). What we can nevertheless do here is replace our undefined
type, `T`, with an equivalently undefined and generic `SEXP` (and let's define
our function while we're at it to square the input):
``` C++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_template (SEXP input)
{
    int result = Rcpp::as <int> (input);
    return result * result;
}
```
This can be then called from **R**, and will return an integer output. (The
`Rcpp::as <int> ()` is a wrapper for `static_cast <int> ()`, which simply
truncates decimals, so `rcpp_template(1.9)` will give 1.) What about generic
return values? The next obvious step would be to try this:
``` C++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP rcpp_template2 (SEXP input)
{
    return input * input;
}
```
This would obviously be rather dangerous if it actually worked, but we don't
need to worry because it fails with this:
``` C++
error: invalid operands to binary expression ('SEXP' (aka 'SEXPREC *') and 'SEXP')
SEXP result = input * input;
                        ~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~
1 error generated.
```
The arrow points to the "operand", indicating that this has defaulted to an
attempt to implement bit-wise multiplication of two generic pointer objects (an
`SEXP` object is nothing but a pointer to the underlying structure it points
to, an `SEXPREC` object). So that all leaves us now knowing that the most we
can do is to send generic inputs from **R** to C++ functions as `SEXP`
parameters, and then coerce them with the magic of `Rcpp::as()`. This is of
course also potentially dangerous:
``` R
rcpp_template (2.9) # = 4; okay
rcpp_template ("2.9")
# Error in rcpp_template(input) :
#   Not compatible with requested type: [type=character; target=integer].
```

Errors like these are generally interpreted to indicate a need to intercept
such errors on the **R** side before they are passed to C++. Doing so, of
course, completely obviates any gains made through permitting a modest degree
of abstraction in C++ anyway, and we're forced to conclude to this point that
minimal templating is possible through use/abuse of `SEXP`, but that that is
generally not a good idea anyway.

## A better level of abstraction

I suggest at this point that a better approach is to leave the templating
exclusively in C++-land, and use Rcpp to provide strict-type interfaces. For
our simple square function, the C++-side would then look like this:
``` C++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_square_int (int input)
{
    return input * input;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_square_dbl (double input)
{
    return input * input;
}
```
These can then be called from the **R** side with a type-explicit wrapper like this:
```{r}
my_square <- function (input)
{
    if (is.integer (input))
        rcpp_square_int (input)
    else if (is.double (input))
        rcpp_square_dbl (input)
}
```
But then there is no abstraction through templating at all! Yeah, but that's
because the above ramblings have hopefully demonstrated that the advantages of
templating in terms of abstracting code ought to be considered to apply to C++
alone, and not either to **R** or Rcpp. Templating still remains entirely
possible, and just as powerful; it should just remain hidden from any exposure
to Rcpp or **R**. I can still define an entirely abstracted C++ class like this:

``` C++
template <class T>
class TemplatedClass
{
    private:
        T _value;

    public:
        DerivedClass (T value) {    // constructor
            _value = value;
        };
        ~DerivedClass () {};        // destructor

        T function ();
};

template <class T>
T DerivedClass<T>::function ()
{
    return _value * _value;
}
```
(With the obvious danger that I need to ensure that `_value
* _value` is meaningful for the given input class.) This can then be used in my
"exposed" Rcpp function through replacing the previous two functions with
type-explicit instanitations of `TemplatedClass`:
``` C++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_square_int (int input)
{
    TemplatedClass <int> cl (input);
    return cl.function ();
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double rcpp_square_dbl (double input)
{
    TemplatedClass <double> cl (input);
    return cl.function ();
}

```
The full power of abstraction through templates now remains in the ability to
define any and all additional functions or properties of `TemplatedClass` in
templated, rather than type-explicit, form. Just don't try to template-away
type-specific abstraction in any Rcpp interfaces. **R** is effectively
type-explicit (the seemingly generic nature of `SEXP` notwithstanding); Rcpp
should be considered in the same way. Leave the power of templating where it
belongs: In C++ (or
