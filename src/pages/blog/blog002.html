C++ templates are really useful. Templates allow you to code a function
able to accept arguments of different types that can’t necessarily be
known until compile time. There is, however, no such thing as an Rcpp
template – all inputs and outputs must have defined types. This blog
entry is about how to maximise the usefulness of C++ templates in an
Rcpp context.

It’s not a difficult process, and as often in programming, it’s about
finding the most efficient level of abstraction. Templates are one of
the coolest ways to “abstract” C++ code – generally meaning abstracting
away from specific variable (class, structure, whatever …) types to
generic templated forms that accept multiple, or indeed any possible,
types. Templates in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rust-lang.org">
rust </a> just work - types are directly inferred, and any potential
conflicts will be caught at compile time.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rust-lang.org">
rust </a> is the gold standard in which template abstraction is as
pain-free as possible. C++ templates are, in contrast, somewhat more
painful, as a minimal generic template must be explicitly specified.
This is often as simple as replacing some function definition, say:

``` c++
int my_function (int my_integer_input)
{
    int result;
    // do something with `my_integer_input`
    return result;
}
```

with a templated version:

``` c++
template <class T>
T my_function_t (T my_integer_input)
{
    T result;
    // do something with `my_integer_input`
    return result;
}
```

As it stands, `my_function_t` will accept inputs of any arbitrary kinds.
(There are also ways to permit templated code to only accept objects of
some pre-defined classes.) An Rcpp version of the first function might
look like this:

``` c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int my_rcpp_function (int my_integer_input)
{
    int result;
    // do something with `my_integer_input`
    return result;
}
```

The problem arises when you try to do something like this:

``` c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
template <class T>
int rcpp_template (T input)
{
    int result = Rcpp::as <int> (input);
    // do something with `result`
    return result;
}
```

and that takes you here:

``` c++
RcppExports.cpp:46:36: error: use of undeclared identifier 'T'
    Rcpp::traits::input_parameter< T >::type input(inputSEXP);
                                                              ^
RcppExports.cpp:46:41: error: no type named 'type' in the global namespace
    Rcpp::traits::input_parameter< T >::type input(inputSEXP);
                                                                    ~~^
2 errors generated.
```

and in this instance provides highly informative error messages that
clearly indicate that the cause is the ability to infer appropriate
`inputSEXP` types (itself a necessity of **R** being written in C, not
C++, and so knowing nothing about inferred types or templates). What we
can nevertheless do here is replace our undefined type, `T`, with an
equivalently undefined and generic `SEXP` (and let’s define our function
while we’re at it to square the input):

``` c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_template (SEXP input)
{
    int result = Rcpp::as <int> (input);
    return result * result;
}
```

This can be then called from **R**, and will return an integer output.
(The `Rcpp::as <int> ()` is a wrapper for `static_cast <int> ()`, which
simply truncates decimals, so `rcpp_template(1.9)` will give 1.) What
about generic return values? The next obvious step would be to try this:

``` c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP rcpp_template2 (SEXP input)
{
    return input * input;
}
```

This would obviously be rather dangerous if it actually worked, but we
don’t need to worry because it fails with this:

``` c++
error: invalid operands to binary expression ('SEXP' (aka 'SEXPREC *') and 'SEXP')
SEXP result = input * input;
                        ~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

The arrow points to the “operand”, indicating that this has defaulted to
an attempt to implement bit-wise multiplication of two generic pointer
objects (an `SEXP` object is nothing but a pointer to the underlying
structure it points to, an `SEXPREC` object). So that all leaves us now
knowing that the most we can do is to send generic inputs from **R** to
C++ functions as `SEXP` parameters, and then coerce them with the magic
of `Rcpp::as()`. This is of course also potentially dangerous:

``` r
rcpp_template (2.9) # = 4; okay
rcpp_template ("2.9")
# Error in rcpp_template(input) :
#   Not compatible with requested type: [type=character; target=integer].
```

Errors like these are generally interpreted to indicate a need to
intercept such errors on the **R** side before they are passed to C++.
Doing so, of course, completely obviates any gains made through
permitting a modest degree of abstraction in C++ anyway, and we’re
forced to conclude to this point that minimal templating is possible
through use/abuse of `SEXP`, but that that is generally not a good idea
anyway.

<section id="A-better-level-of-abstraction" data-magellan-target="A-better-level-of-abstraction"><h2>A better level of abstraction</h></section>

I suggest at this point that a better approach is to leave the
templating exclusively in C++-land, and use Rcpp to provide strict-type
interfaces. For our simple square function, the C++-side would then look
like this:

``` c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_square_int (int input)
{
    return input * input;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_square_dbl (double input)
{
    return input * input;
}
```

These can then be called from the **R** side with a type-explicit
wrapper like this:

``` r
my_squre <- function (input)
{
    if (is.integer (input))
        rcpp_square_int (input)
    else if (is.double (input))
        rcpp_square_dbl (input)
}
```

But then there is no abstraction through templating at all\! Yeah, but
that’s because the above ramblings have hopefully demonstrated that the
advantages of templating in terms of abstracting code ought to be
considered to apply to C++ alone, and not either to **R** or Rcpp.
Templating still remains entirely possible, and just as powerful; it
should just remain hidden from any exposure to Rcpp or **R**. I can
still define an entirely abstracted class like this:

``` c++
template <class T>
class TemplatedClass
{
    private:
        T _value;

    public:
        DerivedClass (T value) {
            _value = value;
        };
        ~DerivedClass () {};

        T function ();
};

template <class T>
T DerivedClass<T>::function ()
{
    return _value * _value;
}
```

(Obviously the only danger there is that I need to ensure that `_value *
_value` is meaningful for the given input class.) This can then be used
in my “exposed” Rcpp function through replacing the previous two
functions with type-explicit instanitations of `TemplatedClass`:

``` c++
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int rcpp_square_int (int input)
{
    TemplatedClass <int> cl (input);
    return cl.function ();
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double rcpp_square_dbl (double input)
{
    TemplatedClass <double> cl (input);
    return cl.function ();
}
```

The full power of abstraction through templates now remains in the
ability to define any and all additional functions or properties of
`TemplatedClass` in templated, rather than type-explicit, form. Just
don’t try to template-away type-specific abstraction in any Rcpp
interfaces. **R** is effectively type-explicit (the seemingly generic
nature of `SEXP` notwithstanding); Rcpp should be considered in the same
way. Leave the power of templating where it belongs: In C++ (or
