<section id="Caching-via-background-R-processes" data-magellan-target="Caching-via-background-R-processes"><h1>Caching via background R processes</h></section>

The title of this blog entry should be fairly self-evident for those who
might incline to read it, yet is motivated by the simple fact that there
currently appear to be no online sources that clearly describe the
relatively straightforward process of using background processes in
**R** to cache objects. (Check out search engine results for
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=caching+background+R+processes&t=ffab&ia=web">
“caching background R processes” </a>: most of the top entries are for
Android, and even opting for other search engines
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!g+caching+background+R+processes&t=ffab&ia=web">
does little to help uncover any useful information </a>.) Caching is
implemented because it saves time, generally by saving the results of
one function call for subsequent reuse. Background processes are also
commonly implemented as time-saving measures, through delegating
long-running tasks to “somewhere else”, allowing you to keep focussing
on whatever (un)important things you were doing in the meantime.

Straightforward caching of the results of single function calls is often
achieved through
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!w+memoization&t=ffab&ia=web">
“memoisation” </a>, implemented in several **R** packages including
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=R.cache">
R.cache </a>,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=memoise">
memoise </a>,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=memo">
memo </a>,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=simpleCache">
simpleCache </a>, and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=simpleRCache">
simpleRCache </a>, not to mention the extremely useful cache-management
package,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=hoardr">
hoardr </a>. None of these packages offer the ability to perform the
caching via a background process, and thus the initial call to a
function to-be-cached will have to wait until that function finishes
before returning a value.

This blog entry describes how to implement caching via background
processes. Using a background process to cache an object naturally
requires a measure of anticipation that the object to be cached is
likely to be useful sometime in the future, as opposed to necessarily
needed right now. This is nevertheless a relatively common situation is
complex, multi-stage analyses, where the results of one stage generally
proceed in a predictable manner to subsequent stages. The typical inputs
and outputs of those subsequent stages are the things that can be
anticipated, and the results pre-calculated via background processes,
and then cached for subsequent *and immediate* recall. So having briefly
described “standard” caching (“foreground” caching, if you like), it’s
time to describe background processes in **R**.

<section id="Background-processes-in-R" data-magellan-target="Background-processes-in-R"><h2>Background processes in R</h></section>

Background processes are, among other things, the key to the much-used
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=future">
future package </a>. This package seems at first like a barely
intelligible miracle of mysterious implementation. What are these
“futures”? The host of highly informative vignettes provide a wealth
of information on how the users of this package can implement their own
“futures”, yet little information on how the futures themselves are
implemented. (This is not a criticism; it reflects a reasonably
self-justifying design choice, because the average user of this package
will be generally satisfied with knowing how to use the package, and
won’t necessarily want or need to know *how* the magic is performed.)

In short: a “future” is just a background process that dumps its results
somewhere ready for later recall. What is a background process? Simply
another **R** session running as a separate
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!w+computer+process&t=ffab&ia=web">
process </a>. It’s easy to implement in base R. We first need a simple
**R** script, as for example generated by the following code:

``` r
my_code <- c ("x <- rnorm (1e6)",
                           "y <- x ^ 2",
                           "y [x < 0] <- -y [x < 0]",
                           "saveRDS (sd (y), file = 'myresult.Rds')")
writeLines (my_code, con = "myfile.R")
```

That script can be executed as a background process by simply calling
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/Rscript.html">
Rscript </a> via a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/system.html">
system </a> or
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/system2.html">
system2 </a> call, where the latter two allow `wait = FALSE` to send the
process to the background. (The more recent implementation of system
calls via the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jeroen/sys">
sys package </a> and its simple `exec_background()` function also
deserve a mention here.) In base R terms, a script can be called from an
interactive session via

``` r
system2 (command = "Rscript", args = "myfile.R", wait = FALSE)
list.files (pattern = "^my")
```

    ## [1] "myfile.R"     "myresult.Rds"

The script has been executed as a background process, and the result
dumped to the file, “myresult.Rds”. This can then simply be read to
retrieve the cached result generated by that background process:

``` r
readRDS ("myresult.Rds")
```

    ## [1] 1.731013

And that value was calculated in, and cached from, a background process.
Simple.

<section id="Complications" data-magellan-target="Complications"><h3>Complications</h></section>

Where was the above value stored? In the working directory of that **R**
session, of course. This is often neither a practicable nor sensible
approach, for example whenever any control over storage locations is
desired. These cached values are generally going to be temporary in
nature, and the `tempdir()` of the current **R** session offers an
alternative location, and is in fact the only location acceptable for
CRAN packages to write to during package tests. Other common options
include a sub-directory of `~/.Rcache`, as used for example in the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=R.cache">
R.cache </a> package. I’ll only consider `tempdir()` from here on, but
doing so will also reveal why the more enduring location of `~/.Rcache`
is often preferred.

Another complication arises in calling
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/Rscript.html">
Rscript </a>, by virtue of the claims in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">
“Writing R Extensions” </a> – the official CRAN guide to **R** packages
– that one should,

> … not invoke R by plain R, Rscript or (on Windows) Rterm in your
> examples, tests, vignettes, makefiles or other scripts. As pointed out
> in several places earlier in this manual, use something like
> “$(R\_HOME)/bin/Rscript” or “$(R\_HOME)/bin$(R\_ARCH\_BIN)/Rterm”

That comment is not very helpful because the alluded “several places”
are in different contexts, and are also only examples rather than actual
guidelines. The problem is those suggestions will usually, *but not
always* work, depending on Operating System idiosyncrasies. So calling
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/Rscript.html">
Rscript </a> directly is less straightforward than it might seem.

A further problem arises in that both `system` and `system2` will
generally return values of `0` when everything works okay. “Works” then
means that the process has been successfully started. But where is that
process in relation to the current **R** session? And likely most
importantly, has that process finished or is it still operating? While
it is possible to use further `system` calls to determine the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!w+process+identifier&t=ffab&ia=web">
process identifier (PID) </a>, that process itself is fraught and
perilous. There are further complications which arise through directly
calling background **R** processes via `Rscript`, but those should
suffice to argue for the fabulous alternative available thanks to Gábor
Csárdi and …

<section id="The-processx-package" data-magellan-target="The-processx-package"><h2>The processx package</h></section>

The
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx">
processx </a> package states simply that it provides,

> “Tools to run system processes in the background”

This package is designed to run *any* available system process,
including ones that potentially have nothing to do with **R** let alone
a current **R** session. Using
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx">
processx </a> to run background **R** process thus requires calling
`Rscript`, with the associated problems described above. Fortunately for
us, Gábor foresaw this need and created the “companion” package,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r-lib/callr">
callr </a> to simply

> “Call R from R”

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r-lib/callr">
callr </a> relies directly on
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx">
processx </a>, but provides the far simpler function,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html">
r\_bg </a> to

> “Evaluate an expression in another R session, in the background”

So
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html">
r\_bg </a> provides the perfect tool for our needs. This function
directly evaluates R code, without needing to render it to text as we
did above in order to write it to an external script file. An
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html">
r\_bg </a> version of the above would look like this:

``` r
f <- function () {
    x <- rnorm (1e6)
    y <- x ^ 2
    y [x < 0] <- -y [x < 0]
    saveRDS (sd (y), file = "myresult.Rds")
}
callr::r_bg (f)
```

    ## PROCESS 'R', running, pid 18410.

We immediately see that
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html">
r\_bg </a> returns a handle to the process itself, along with the single
piece of critical diagnostic information: Whether the process is still
running or not:

``` r
px <- callr::r_bg (f)
px
```

    ## PROCESS 'R', running, pid 18418.

``` r
Sys.sleep (1)
px
```

    ## PROCESS 'R', finished.

Multiple processes can be generated and queried this way. The package is
designed around, and returns,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r-lib/R6">
R6 </a> class objects, enabling function calls on the objects, notably
including the following:

``` r
px <- callr::r_bg (f)
px
```

    ## PROCESS 'R', running, pid 18440.

``` r
while (px$is_alive())
    px$wait ()
px
```

    ## PROCESS 'R', finished.

The `px$is_alive()` and `px$wait()` functions are all that is needed to
wait until a background process is finished. In the context of using
background processes to cache objects, these lines enable the primary
**R** session to simply wait until caching is finished before retrieving
the object.

<section id="processx-callr-and-caching" data-magellan-target="processx-callr-and-caching"><h2>processx, callr, and caching</h></section>

There is only one remaining issue with the above code: Where is
“myresult.Rds” in the following code?

``` r
f <- function () {
    x <- rnorm (1e6)
    y <- x ^ 2
    y [x < 0] <- -y [x < 0]
    saveRDS (sd (y), file = file.path (tempdir (), "myresult.Rds"))
}
px <- callr::r_bg (f)
```

It’s in `tempdir()`, but *not* the `tempdir()` of the current process.
Where is his other `tempdir()`? It’s temporary of course, so has been
dutifully cleaned up, thereby removing our desired result. What is
needed is a way to store the result in the `tempdir()`of the current –
active – **R** session. This `tempdir()` is merely specified as a
character string, which we can pass directly to our function:

``` r
f <- function (temp_dir) {
    x <- rnorm (1e6)
    y <- x ^ 2
    y [x < 0] <- -y [x < 0]
    saveRDS (sd (y), file = file.path (temp_dir, "mynewresult.Rds"))
}
```

We then only need to note that the second parameter of
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html">
r\_bg </a> is `args`, which is,

> “Arguments to pass to the function. Must be a list.”

That is then all we need, so let it run …

``` r
px <- callr::r_bg (f, list (tempdir ()))
while (px$is_alive())
    px$wait ()
list.files (tempdir (), pattern = "^my")
```

    ## [1] "mynewresult.Rds"

And there is our new result, along with all we need to understand how to
cache objects via background **R** processes.

<section id="Summary" data-magellan-target="Summary"><h2>Summary</h></section>

1.  Define a function to generate the object to be cached, and include a
    `tempdir()` parameter if that is to be used as the cache location.
2.  Use `callr::r_bg()` to call that function in the background and
    deliver the result to the desired location.
3.  Examine the handle of the process returned by `r_bg()` to determine
    whether it has finished or not.
4.  … use the cached result.
