# privacy statement

This site don't collect nothing, and there's nothing you can do to make it do
so. You can't log in; you can't track anything other than the pages people look
at. But the site itself won't even do that. There are no analytics; there is no
way the site itself can or will track who looks at what, how often, or how many.
Well, okay, "you can't log in" is not quite true - commenting requires logging
in. To github. And that only so that the magic of

    github site of this blog</a>. Nothing is done with those data, and your
identity is not used in any way other than to enable you to comment on github.
There are no cookies, nor are any loaded by any other libraries used to serve
this site. No external calls are made to load fonts, because they are embedded

have visited the site, there are also no advertisements, nor will there ever be,
so you'll be safe there too.
