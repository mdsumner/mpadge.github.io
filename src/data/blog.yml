    title: how i made this site
    description: This site is built with zurb foundation, because i had read
        that it did everything that hugo could, but that final products were
        more lightweight and flexible. Plus i had no idea about it, and learning
        something new is sometimes worthwhile. I was also frustrated that
        standard hugo advice seemed to be, ''oh, just pick a template and off
        you go,'' yet there is surprisingly little advice on how to modify any
        given template, let alone how to start from scratch. It turned out that
        foundation at least made starting from scratch fairly easy, and so this
        entry is about that process.
